Knight's Quest: A Turn-Based Strategy Game


* Features two teams, the human and computer teams. Both can have the same pieces. The goal is to kill all of the enemies pieces.

* Each piece can either attack, defend, or rest as an “action”. Movement is independent of the action. Each piece can move its maximum move range every turn.
  Pieces will grey out when they are out of movement.
  
* Attacking allows a piece to do damage to an enemy piece.

* Defending allows a piece to reduce the amount of damage it takes if attacked.

* Resting allows a piece to regain health each turn. However, damage taken is increased by 50% if a player is attacked while resting.

* New levels unlock when the user beats a level for the first time

** NOTE ** If you would like to bypass the unlock level mechanic, edit the profile/completedLevels.info file. This file contains a list of
levels that have been completed on the first line, so it should be empty if you haven't played the game before. To make all levels playable, change the
first line to be:

1,2,3,4

This will unlock all levels.
